The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `bin` -  folder that the compiled output files will be generated in by default
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `cs250`: contains `hw4`
    - `hw4`: contains `.java` files created for the assignment
        - `BinaryTree.java`: contains code implementations of tasks associated with Binary Tree.
        - `BTree.java`: contains code implementations of tasks associated with B-Tree.
        - `TreeStructure.java`: contains TreeStructure interface required to complete the assignment
- `data.txt`: is a test file used to assure code's correct execution
        

Commands used to run code on my machine:

`javac cs250/hw4/*.java `
`java cs250.hw4.BinaryTree ../data.txt`
